# 🌍 AI4S Hackathon — Empowering African Innovation through Responsible AI

## Overview

The **AI for Sustainability (AI4S) Program** is a flagship initiative under the **Data Governance in Africa** project, empowering African startups and innovators to apply **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** for sustainable development.  
It focuses on three core pillars:
- **Agritech innovation** — supporting digital transformation in food systems  
- **Data governance** — promoting responsible and ethical data use  
- **Inclusive digital ecosystems** — ensuring equitable access to AI benefits  

The **AI4S Hackathon**, implemented in Kenya by **Impact Hub Nairobi** in partnership with **Digital Africa**, is designed to help innovators build data-driven, responsible AI solutions tackling agricultural and sustainability challenges across the continent.

## 🚜 Challenge Spotlight: AI-Driven Credit Scoring

### Problem Context
Smallholder farmers across Africa remain underserved by traditional financial institutions because:
- They lack formal credit histories.  
- Traditional credit scoring relies on limited or unavailable data.  
- The result: low access to inputs (seeds, fertilizer, irrigation) → perpetuating **low yields** and **debt cycles**.

### Objective
Develop an **AI-powered credit scoring system** using **alternative and synthetic data** to assess farmer creditworthiness and enable **affordable, seasonal loans**.

---

## 🎯 Thematic Focus

**Challenge Question:**
> “How might we build AI models that accurately, fairly, and transparently assess smallholder farmers’ creditworthiness — even where conventional data is missing — to unlock affordable and inclusive financing?”

Teams will:
- Design, train, and evaluate ML models  
- Use open or synthetic datasets  
- Simulate real-world lending decisions for smallholder farmers in Kenya

---

## ⚙️ Technical Development Track 2: Risk & Loan Simulation Engine

**Goal:** Transform model outputs into real-world lending intelligence.

**Core Components:**
- **Loan Recommendation Logic:** Suggest loan size, interest rate, and repayment schedule  
- **Dynamic Risk Updates:** Refresh risk scores as new data (weather, behavior) is received  
- **What-if Testing:** Simulate shocks such as droughts or market fluctuations  
- **Visualization Dashboard:** Display risk, repayment rates, and loan performance  

---

## 📦 Expected Deliverables

By the end of **Day 3**, each team should submit:
1. **Trained Model / Notebook** – a reproducible ML pipeline (Python, R, or Colab)  
2. **Loan Simulation Logic** – rules or code linking model predictions to lending decisions  
3. **Technical Narrative** – a 5–7 page documentation outlining assumptions, methods, and scalability  
4. **Pitch Deck** – a 7-minute presentation for the jury  

---

## 🤖 AI Opportunities & Exploration

Teams are encouraged to explore innovative techniques such as:
- **Synthetic Data Generation** — using Faker, SDV, or sklearn.make_*  
- **Bias Mitigation** — applying fairness metrics and inclusion-oriented modeling  
- **Explainable AI (XAI)** — integrating SHAP, LIME, and model transparency tools  
- **Transfer Learning** — adapting models from related agricultural datasets  
- **Open-Source Ethics** — building reproducible, scalable, and transparent pipelines  

---

## ⚖️ Key Considerations

When developing your prototype, ensure:
- **Fairness:** Avoid bias across gender, region, or farm size.  
- **Transparency:** Clearly explain model decision logic.  
- **Scalability:** Ensure adaptability to real agri-finance systems.  
- **Documentation:** Keep all code clean, modular, and reproducible.  

---

## 🧩 What You’ll Build

Each team will produce:
- A **working AI prototype** or proof of concept
